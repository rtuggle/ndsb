Booz Allen is co-sponsoring the first-ever National Data Science Bowl, a nationwide competition that uses data science to take on a global challenge. The competition addresses a question that has stumped marine biologists for decades. Check out the video describing the challenge on YouTube. Could the answer lie in data?

The competition is open to everyone, including Booz Allen staff, from now until March 16, 2015. The Employee Guidelines explain the rules unique for our staff. While Booz Allen staff are not eligible for the cash prizes, we will recognize staff contributions.

Start spreading the word among your personal and professional networksâ€”the competition is open to everyone, 18 years old and older. Visit www.DataScienceBowl.com for more details.
